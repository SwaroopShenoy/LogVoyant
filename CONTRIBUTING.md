# Contributing to LogVoyant

Thanks for considering contributing! LogVoyant is a learning project and all contributions are welcome.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
1. Check if the bug is already reported in [Issues](https://github.com/SwaroopShenoy/logvoyant/issues)
2. If not, open a new issue with:
   - Clear title
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment (OS, Go version)
   - Logs if applicable

### Suggesting Features
1. Open an issue with the `enhancement` label
2. Describe the use case
3. Explain why it would be useful
4. (Optional) Suggest implementation approach

### Code Contributions

#### First Time?
Look for issues labeled `good first issue` - these are beginner-friendly tasks.

#### Process
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Write/update tests if applicable
5. Run tests: `go test ./...`
6. Commit with clear messages: `git commit -m "Add feature X"`
7. Push: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
8. Open a Pull Request

#### Code Style
- Follow standard Go conventions (`gofmt`, `golint`)
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for non-obvious logic
- Update documentation if needed

#### Commit Messages
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Be descriptive but concise
- Reference issues: "Fix #123: Handle nil pointer in analyzer"
