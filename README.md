## Why LogVoyant?

**Not another enterprise monitoring platform.** LogVoyant is built for developers who need quick answers, not complex dashboards.

- **Zero Setup** - No YAML. No agents. No database. Just run it.
- **Works Offline** - Pattern matching built-in. LLM analysis optional.
- **Context-Aware** - Remembers past issues. Connects the dots across analyses.
- **Local-First** - Your logs stay on your machine. No cloud required.
- **One Binary** - 10MB, no dependencies, runs anywhere.

Perfect for:
- 🐛 Debugging failed deployments
- 🔥 Troubleshooting prod incidents locally
- 📚 Learning from past issues
- ⚡ Quick log analysis without Datadog bills

## Features

### 🎯 Auto-Discovery
Automatically finds and tails logs from:
- Kubernetes pods (via `kubectl`)
- Docker containers
- Local files (`/var/log/*`)

### 🧠 Smart Analysis
- **Pattern Matching**: 20+ common errors (OOMKilled, CrashLoopBackOff, timeouts)
- **LLM Analysis**: Optional AI-powered root cause analysis (free Groq API)
- **Historical Context**: Tracks recurring issues and suggests fixes based on past analyses

### 📊 Clean Web UI
- Live log streaming
- Side-by-side logs and analysis
- Timeline of past issues
- Mark issues as resolved

### 🚀 Zero Config
```bash
logvoyant start
# That's it. UI opens at localhost:3100
```

---

## Quick Start

### Install
```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -sSL https://logvoyant.sh | sh

# Or download from releases
# https://github.com/SwaroopShenoy/logvoyant/releases
```

### Run
```bash
logvoyant start

# With AI analysis (optional)
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here  # Get free key at groq.com
logvoyant start

# Custom port
logvoyant start --port 8080
```

### Use
1. Open `http://localhost:3100`
2. Select a log stream
3. Click **Analyze** to get insights
4. See root cause + suggested fixes

## How It Works

```
Your Logs → Auto-Discover → Tail → Analyze → Show Insights
                ↓            ↓        ↓
            kubectl      Stream   Pattern
            docker        to UI    Matching
            files                    +
                                  LLM (opt)
```

**Context Tracking:**
Every analysis is stored as context. Future analyses reference past issues to give you better insights over time.

Example:
```
Analysis 1 (10:00 AM): "DB_HOST env var missing"
Analysis 2 (11:00 AM): "Still timing out - network policy issue"
                       ↳ References previous DB_HOST context
```
